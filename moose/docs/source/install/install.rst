Use pre-built packages
-----------------------

Linux
^^^^^^

We recommend that you use our repositories hosted at `Open Build Service
<https://build.opensuse.org/package/show/home:moose/moose>`_.  We have build
packages for most linux distributions.
Visit `this page
<https://software.opensuse.org/download.html?project=home:moose&package=moose>`_
to pick your distribution and follow instructions.

.. note::
    ``moogli`` (tool to visualize network activity) is not available for CentOS-6.


MacOSX
^^^^^^

MacOSX support is not complete yet. The GUI does not work due to compatibility isses with `PyQt` package 
available on homebrew `See status of this ticket <https://github.com/BhallaLab/moose-gui/issues/18>`_.
Python interface is available (latest version 3.1.2. `Status <https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-science/pull/5835>`_) 
and can be installed on MaxOSX using ``homebrew``
::

    $ brew install homebrew/science/moose


Building MOOSE
--------------

In case your distribution is not listed on `our repository page
<https://software.opensuse.org/download.html?project=home:moose&package=moose>`_
, or if you want to build the lastest development code, read on.

First, you need to get the source code. You can use ``git`` (clone the
repository) or download snapshot of github repo by clicking on `this link
<https://github.com/BhallaLab/moose/archive/master.zip>`_.::

    $ git clone https://github.com/BhallaLab/moose --depth 100

This will create folder called "moose" with source code. Or,
::

    $ wget https://github.com/BhallaLab/moose/archive/master.zip
    $ unzip master.zip

You can download other released versions from `here
<`https://github.com/BhallaLab/moose/releases>`_.

Install dependencies
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Depending on your operating system, names of following packages may vary.

Python interface for core MOOSE API (pymoose)
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
- Required
    - Python For building the MOOSE Python bindings
    - Python development headers and libraries, e.g. `python-dev` or `python-devel`
    - NumPy ( >= 1.6.x) For array interface, e.g. `python-numpy` or `numpy`

- Optional
    - NetworkX (1.x). Layout is of chemical models is computed using networkx.
    - Matplotlib (>=1.1.x) For plotting simulation results
    - python-libsbml For reading and writing chemical models in SBML format.

Most of the dependencies can be installed using package manager.

On ``Debian/Ubuntu``
::

    $ sudo apt-get install libhdf5-dev cmake libgsl0-dev libpython-dev python-numpy

.. note::

    Ubuntu 12.04 does not have required version of ``gsl`` (required 1.16 or
    higher, available 1.15). On Ubuntu 16.04, package name is ``libgsl-dev``.

On ``CentOS/Fedora/RHEL/Scientific Linux``
::

    $ sudo yum install hdf5-devel cmake libgsl-dev python-devel python-numpy

On ``SUSE/OpenSUSE``
::

  $ sudo zypper install hdf5-devel cmake libgsl-dev python-devel python-numpy

build moose
^^^^^^^^^^^

.. code-block:: bash

   $ cd /to/moose/source/code
   $ mkdir _build
   $ cd _build
   $ cmake  ..
   $ make -j2    # using 2 core to build MOOSE
   $ ctest --output-on-failure  # optional
   $ sudo make install 

This will build MOOSE's python extention, `ctest` will run few tests to check if build process was successful.

.. note::

  To install MOOSE into non-standard directory, pass additional argument
  `-DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=path/to/install/dir` to cmake
  ::

    $ cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIC=$HOME/.local ..

  To use different version of python
  ::

    $ cmake -DPYTHON_EXECUTABLE=/opt/python3/bin/python3 ..

After that installation is pretty easy
::

  $ sudo make install

If everything went fine, you should be able to import moose in python shell.

.. code-block::  python

   >>> import moose

Graphical User Interface (GUI)
------------------------------

MOOSE-gui can be launched by running the following command
::
  
  $ moosegui 
   
Below are packages which you may need to install to be able to launch MOOSE Graphical User Interface.

- Required:
    - PyQt4 (4.8.x)
    
On ``Ubuntu/Debian``, these can be installed with
::

    $ sudo apt-get install python-qt4

On ``CentOS/Fedora/RHEL``
::

    $ sudo yum install python-qt4

.. note::

    If you have installed ``moose`` package, then GUI is launched by
    running following commnad::

    $ moosegui

Building moogli
---------------

``moogli`` is subproject of ``MOOSE`` for visualizing models. More details can
be found `here <http://moose.ncbs.res.in/moogli>`_.

`Moogli` is part of `moose` package. Building moogli can be tricky because of
multiple depednecies it has.

- Required
    - OSG (3.2.x) For 3D rendering and simulation of neuronal models
    - Qt4 (4.8.x) For C++ GUI of Moogli

To get the latest source code of ``moogli``, click on `this link <https://github.com/BhallaLab/moogli/archive/master.zip>`_.

Moogli depends on ``OpenSceneGraph`` (version 3.2.0 or higher) which may not
be easily available for your operating system.
For this reason, we distribute required ``OpenSceneGraph`` with ``moogli``
source code.

Depending on distribution of your operating system, you would need following
packages to be installed.

On ``Ubuntu/Debian``
::

    $ sudo apt-get install python-qt4-dev python-qt4-gl python-sip-dev libqt4-dev

On ``Fedora/CentOS/RHEL``
::

    $ sudo yum install sip-devel PyQt4-devel qt4-devel libjpeg-devel PyQt4

On ``openSUSE``
::

    $ sudo zypper install python-sip python-qt4-devel libqt4-devel python-qt4

After this, building and installing ``moogli`` should be as simple as
::

    $ cd /path/to/moogli
    $ mkdir _build
    $ cd _build
    $ cmake ..
    $ make
    $ sudo make install

If you run into troubles, please report it on our `github repository
<https://github.com/BhallaLab/moose/issues>`_.
