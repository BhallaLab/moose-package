This directory contains MOOSE user documentation.

The documentation is encoded in the Markdown format. Each of the Markdown
files is converted to corresponding reStructuredText (rst) file by running "python markdown2rst.py" which creates rst file into corresponding directory.
To convert rst files, one needs to go to respective directory e.g Rdesigneur run "make html" in terminal, which
creates corresponding HTML file for viewing in a browser in "_build/html" directory.
To learn more about the Markdown
format itself, go to the other 'markdown' directory one level up, in the
main 'docs' directory.

Here are some of the important files:
	- markdown/MooseGuiDocs.markdown:
			"MOOSEGUI: Graphical interface for MOOSE"
	- markdown/Kkit12Documentation.markdown:
			"Kinetikit 12: Interface for chemical kinetic models in MOOSEGUI"
	- markdown/RdesigneurDocumentation:markdown:
			"Reaction Diffusion and Electrical SIGnaling in NEURons):Interface
			 to the multiscale modeling capabilities in MOOSE"
	- markdown/Nkit2Documentation.markdown:
			"Neuronal simulations in MOOSEGUI". THIS IS CURRENTLY NOT INCLUDED

        - snippets/snippets.rst:
			A diverse collection of snippets: (mostly) short code examples illustrating different features of MOOSE
	- tutorials/tutorials.rst:
			A set of tutorials for teaching a range of topics, including integrate-and-fire networks, chemical bistables, and oscillators. 
			Has stand-alone graphics and the Python scripts are meant to tinker with.

    - py/create_rest_doc.py: This Python script compiles all the inline 
            documentation for MOOSE classes and functions, as visible in the
            MOOSE Python module, into a reST text file.
    - py/index.rst: This is the index file for use when building the Python
            docs using sphinx.
    - py/moose_builtins.rst: This is for sphinx to process the pymoose builtin 
            doc strings (using autodoc extension)
    - py/moose_classes.rst: This is generated by running py/create_rest_doc.py
            and has the extracted inline documentation of MOOSE classes and
            their fields.
	- build: Shell script to do the necessary compilation and conversions.

N.B.: This text file has Windows-style line endings (CR/LF) for easy
viewing in Windows. We will try to keep the other text files here
Windows-compatible (e.g.: *.markdown files), but we may slip.
If you have difficulty viewing them in Notepad, try the inbuilt Wordpad
editor, or better still, download a good text editor like Notepad++ or Geany.
